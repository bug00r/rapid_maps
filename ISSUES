NEW:
    - Selection on rotated Images does not respect new rotated size but the old rescaled size


FIXED:
1. Scaling error in c++ Image
        File "E:\dev\projects\github\python\projects\rapid_maps\rapidmaps\mapui\main.py", line 437, in OnMapZoom
        self.__scaled_image = self.__bg_image.Scale(self.__bg_image.Width*scale_factor, self.__bg_image.Height*scale_factor)
        wx._core.wxAssertionError: C++ assertion "data" failed at ..\..\src\common\image.cpp(503) in wxImage::ResampleNearest(): unable to create image

    Solution: using own scale and scrolling see TODO-Item-4
